![Dashboard Overview](Images/Project1_Dashboard_Overview.gif)

## 📘 Project Summary

The **Data Jobs Dashboard** was developed as a data storytelling and exploration tool aimed at **job seekers, data analysts, and ML professionals** looking to understand hiring trends in the tech industry. Using a real dataset of 2024 data science job listings, the dashboard consolidates fragmented job market data into a unified, analytical report—offering insight into job titles, compensation, work location types, and more.

Built entirely in **Power BI**, this project mimics the responsibilities of a data analyst and highlights how data visualization can support decision-making and strategic planning.
